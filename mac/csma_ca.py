class CsmaCa:
    """
    Medium access control protocol: CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access With Collision Avoidance) without RTS/CTS

    The basic flow of the basic CSMA/CA (without RTS/CTS) is as follows:
        1) when a node has a packet to send, it first needs to wait until the channel is idle
        2) when the channel is idle, the node starts a timer and waits for "DIFS+backoff" periods of time, where the
           length of backoff is related to the number of re-transmissions
        3) if the entire decrement of the timer to 0 is not interrupted, then the node can occupy the channel and start
           sending the data packet and waiting for the corresponding ACK
        4) if the countdown is interrupted, it means that the node loses the game. The node should freeze the timer and
           wait for channel idle again before re-starting its timer

    Main attributes:
        my_drone: the drone that installed the CSMA/CA protocol
        simulator: the simulation platform that contains everything
        rng_mac: a Random class based on which we can call the function that generates the random number
        env: simulation environment created by simpy
        phy: the installed physical layer
        channel_states: used to determine if the channel is idle
        enable_ack: use ack or not
